## Phone Alarm Site
This was something I made for the final project of the JavaScript Basics course in 2022. We were tasked by our teacher to create a site that
functioned as a search engine of sorts that forwarded input to Google or Bing after logging in with a preset username and password. We were
also supposed to have a fake sign-up page with validation. I decided to model the two pages that comprise this after Bing and Microsoft's 
login screen respectively. With this latest edition of the site, I have added a new function: storing the data from the signup page in LocalStorage
for later use.
